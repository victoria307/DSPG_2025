## Setup

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Use the BLS API to retrieve the data

```{r}
# Set the library and install the packages
library(devtools)
library(blsR)

# The introduction about this package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blsR/blsR.pdf
devtools::install_github("groditi/blsR")

# Acquire the API by registering through https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm
bls_set_key("your personal API")

test_series <- get_series(series_id = "series id you found", 
                         start_year = 2016, 
                         end_year = 2024, 
                         api_key = bls_get_key())
```

I work through the series number by https://data.bls.gov/PDQWeb/la, and we discover that the series number for each county is "FCN+Fips code+00000000"
